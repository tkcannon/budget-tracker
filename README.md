# Budget Tracker

## Description

This was a Challenge through the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. We were given a Budget Tracker app that we updated to a PWA (Progressive Web App), using a Service-Worker to cache site data and indexedDB to save transactions for offline funcitonality. Saved transactions are uploaded to the server upon reconnecting to the internet.
